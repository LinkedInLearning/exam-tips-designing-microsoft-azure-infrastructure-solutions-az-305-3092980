The Azure Solutions Architect Expert certification is designed to measure a candidate's ability to design a cloud and hybrid infrastructure on Azure. This includes running compute, network, storage, monitoring, and security solutions. To earn this certification, you must first earn your Azure Administrator Associate certification, and then pass the AZ-305 exam: Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions
 


In this course, Microsoft Certified Solution Architect Nicole Stevens provides a primer for those interested in taking the exam or who need a refresher before sitting for the exam. She gives an overview of this certification and highlights the four main functional groups of the AZ-305 exam. If youâ€™re interested in gaining your Azure Solutions Architect Expert certification, join Nicole in this course to get started.
