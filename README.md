## Instructions
This repository does not have any branches. Download the entire repository and you get the demo environments and other setups to look at, all in their final state.

Each folder top level folder corresponds to a chapter, with a folder underneath containing bicep files which build environments shown in the course videos.

The instructions to follow for each video are in the [tips-readme.md](tips-readme.md) file. This file has a section for each video in this course that had a demo environment or further tips through hands on practice.

These files are designed to be run in Azure Cloudshell. You do not require anything installed locally to use these files.  However, if you would like to study the files locally I recommend the following:
